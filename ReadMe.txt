# Temperature Conversion Tool

This is a simple temperature conversion tool implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Features

- Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Display conversion results on the web page.
- Handles conversion for all possible input and output combinations.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter the temperature value in the input field.
4. Select the input temperature type (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) from the dropdown menu.
5. Select the desired output temperature type from the dropdown menu.
6. Click the "Calculate" button to perform the conversion.
7. The converted temperature will be displayed on the page.

## Implementation Details

- The JavaScript code uses DOM manipulation to interact with HTML elements and perform temperature conversions.
- Event listeners are added to the calculate button to trigger the conversion when clicked.
- A switch statement is used to handle different input and output temperature combinations and perform the appropriate conversion calculations.

## Example

Suppose you enter `25` as the temperature value and select `Celsius` as the input type and `Fahrenheit` as the output type. Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the tool will convert `25 degrees Celsius` to its equivalent in Fahrenheit and display the result on the page.
